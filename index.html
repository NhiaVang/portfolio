            <p>Currently, I am a merchandising pricing analyst for NAPA Auto Parts. I have strong knowledge in mathematics, 
                statistics, and analytics. I received a bachelor in mathematics and a master in analytics. With that being said,
                I enjoy sport analytics and doing research about mathematics. Even with those degrees, I barely used any of those 
                in my day to day work. So, that means my job is as boring as I can imagine. Before being an analyst, I actually 
                served in the Navy for eight years which I totally enjoy. I had the chance to visit many countires and got to know 
                their culture.</p>
            <p>Aside from that, I enjoy working on cars, playing and watching sports mainly in football and soccer. If I am not 
                doing any of those hobbies, I make every effort to spend quality time with the families. </p>
